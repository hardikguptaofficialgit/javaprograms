//1. Aim of the program -Define an interface Motor with a data member –capacity and two methods such as run() and consume(). Define a Java class ‘Washing machine’ which implements this interface and write the code to check the value of the interface data member thru an object of the class.
//Input - mentioned in the program
//Output - Capacity of the motor is -----


interface Motor {
    int capacity = 5; // interface data member (public static final by default)
    void run();
    void consume();
}

class WashingMachine implements Motor {

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Washing machine is running");
    }

    public void consume() {
        System.out.println("Washing machine is consuming power");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WashingMachine wm = new WashingMachine();
        System.out.println("Capacity of the motor is " + Motor.capacity);
    }
}
